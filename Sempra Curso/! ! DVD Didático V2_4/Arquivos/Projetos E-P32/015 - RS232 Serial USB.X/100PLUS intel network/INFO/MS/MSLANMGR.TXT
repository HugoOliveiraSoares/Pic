                                                                    v1.06


LAN Manager* 2.2 Workstation/Server installation notes for Intel's
EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ PCI LAN Adapter
==================================================================

Location of Driver: \NDIS\MSLANMAN.BAT


MSLANMAN.BAT will create the following directory structure on a local
hard drive:
   
   \MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\E100B\E100B.DOS (DOS NDIS driver)
   \MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\E100B\PROTOCOL.INI
   \MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\NIF\E100B.NIF
   
   \MSLANMAN.OS2\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\E100B\E100B.OS2 (OS/2 NDIS driver)
   \MSLANMAN.OS2\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\E100B\PROTOCOL.INI
   \MSLANMAN.OS2\DRIVERS\NIF\E100B.NIF


Sample Configuration Files
--------------------------

CONFIG.SYS (for DOS) will include these lines:
   
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\LANMAN
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN\E100B.DOS

CONFIG.SYS (for OS/2) will include these lines:
   
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN\PROTMAN /I:C:\LANMAN
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN\E100B.OS2

PROTOCOL.INI will contain these lines:
   
   [E100B_NIF]
   ; PROTOCOL.INI section for Intel EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ adapters
   
   DRIVERNAME = E100B$


General Installation
--------------------

1  Create the directory structure needed for the LAN Manager installation
   by running the batch file MSLANMAN.BAT.  It will create the
   directories at the root of the specified drive and copy the necessary
   files.

2  Run the appropriate Microsoft LAN Manager setup for the computer you
   are setting up (DOS, OS/2 or OS/2 Server). When prompted for the LAN
   adapter driver, select "Other Driver" (the EtherExpress PRO/100+
   driver isn't included on the LAN Manager disk) and specify the drive
   from step 1. Select the EtherExpress PRO/100+ driver and follow the
   directions.

3  If you are using DOS, copy the EMM386.EXE from your DOS directory to the
   \MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\DOSUTILS directory.

4  When completed, reboot your computer in order for changes to take
   effect.


Hints and Tips
--------------

1  Parameters for the PROTOCOL.INI file:
   
   DRIVERNAME: (required) If you have a single adapter, use the syntax in
      the Sample Configuration file section.  If you are installing
      multiple adapters, each adapter must have a unique driver name.
      Additional instances of the driver would be referenced by
      DRIVERNAME=E100Bx$, where "x" is a unique number 2 through 9.
   
   SPEED: (optional; parameters are [Auto / 10 / 100]) The parameter
      disables Auto-Speed Detect and causes the adapter to function at
      the speed indicated. If the FORCEDUPLEX parameter is assigned to
      either 1 or 2, the SPEED parameter is required because auto-speed
      sensing is disabled if the duplex mode is forced. Auto-negotiate
      devices cannot detect speed changes in this configuration until the
      driver is reloaded.[Example: SPEED=100]
   
   FORCEDUPLEX: Full duplex and auto-negotiate capabilities vary between
      the PRO/100 TX and the PRO/100 T4 adapters.

         EtherExpress PRO/100+ TX adapter: Supports auto-negotiate, full
         and half duplex at 10 or 100 Mbps.

         EtherExpress PRO/100B T4 adapter: Supports full and half duplex
         at 10 Mbps; supports only half duplex at 100 Mbps.  Auto-
         negotiate is not a valid option at either speed.
   
      This parameter disables Auto-Negotiate capability and forces the
      adapter to operate in Half or Full Duplex mode. The SPEED parameter
      must be specified and must be valid if the default of Auto-
      negotiate is changed. Options for FORCEDUPLEX are Auto (for auto-
      negotiate), 1 (for half), 2 (for full). [Example: FORCEDUPLEX = 2]
   
   SLOT: (required for multiple adapters) This parameter is optional if
      only one adapter is present.  If it is specified but is incorrect,
      a message indicates that the value doesn't match the configuration
      but the driver finds the adapter and loads anyway.
   
      This parameter is required if more than one adapter is present in
      either one bus or multiple PCI buses of a system. The parameter
      tells the driver which adapter it controls. The SLOT number is the
      encoded value of the PCI adapter's device location. To determine
      the slot number, load the driver with only the DRIVERNAME parameter
      specified.  The driver reports all the slots that have PCI
      adapter(s) installed. You can determine which card is in which slot
      by using SETUP.EXE and matching the Ethernet addresses of the
      adapter to the device number specified in View Configuration.
   
      [Example: SLOT=0x1C]
   
   NODE: (optional) This value sets the adapter's Individual Address,
      overriding the value read from the adapter EEprom. The address must
      consist of 12 hexadecimal digits, enclosed in double quotes.  The
      value can not be all zeros. The value can not have the Multicast
      bit set. So, use only the hexadecimal digits 2, 6, A, or E as the
      second digit of the twelve required in the NODE ADDRESS parameter.
      Use any hexadecimal digits in all other positions.
   
      [Example: NODE = "02AA00123456"]
