Windows NT* 4.0 installation notes for Intel's EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+
LAN Adapter
========================================================================
LOCATION OF DRIVER:    \NT\E100BNT.SY_ (NDIS 4.0 compressed)
                       \OEMSETUP.INF
      
      Note: NT 4.0 ships with a driver for the PRO/100B.  However, it is
            recommended that you install the more recent driver contained
            on the Configuration and Drivers diskette.


General Instructions
--------------------


After putting the adapter in the computer, you need to configure it under
Windows NT.

1  Double-click the Network icon in the Control Panel.

2  Select the "Adapter" tab and click Add...

3  Select Have Disk. Insert the PRO/100+ Drivers Disk in the disk driver
   and click OK.

5  Select "Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ PCI Adapter (TX or T4)" from the
   list of available drivers and click OK.

6  The Intel PROSet Setup program automatically scans computer resources
   and determines the settings assigned to your adapter.  It also adds an
   Intel PROSet icon to the Control Panel for future use of PROSet.

7  (Optional) You can test the adapter by clicking the Test button.

8  To exit PROSet and finish installing the driver, click OK in the
   PROSet main menu.

9  Select the protocol(s) required (TCP/IP is the default) by selecting
   the Protocol Tab.

10 Select the network services required (by default, all are selected) by
   selecting the Service tab.

11 Click Close to continue.  Other Configuration screens may appear.
   configure as desired.

   Note that after the driver is installed, NT may show the adapter as
   "Intel 82557-based 10/100 Ethernet PCI Adapter".  PROSet will display
   the adapter specifically as "Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ PCI 100Base-
   TX, 10BaseT" adapter.  Also, The NDIS 4.0 miniport driver will
   automatically get installed in Windows NT 4.0.

12 When prompted, restart NT.

13 Repeat the General Instruction process for installing additional
   adapters.


ADAPTER SETTINGS


There are two ways to run PROSet, which allows changing the adapter
settings.
   
   - From the Control Panel double-click on the Intel PROSet icon.
   
   - From the Control Panel, double-click on the Network icon, select the
   adapters section, and double-click on the "Intel 82557-based 10/100
   Ethernet PCI adapter".


From the main Intel PROSet menu click the Change button to get to the
Adapter Settings screen. The defaults work correctly for most
configurations.


Network Speed
-------------

Recommended setting:  Auto (default)

This parameter lets the EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter know what speed to
use on the Ethernet wire.  The choices are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and Auto.
In Auto mode, the adapter detects if its environment can support 100 Mbps
speed. It then sets the speed to 100 if it can, or 10 if it can't. If you
are using a cross over cable connected to another adapter, set the speed
to either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps.
      
      Note: If the Duplex Mode is not set to Auto, then set the speed to
            either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps.


DUPLEX MODE (100BASE-T4 does not support full duplex)
-----------

Recommended setting: Auto (PRO/100+ TX adapter only)
      
      Auto: The adapter negotiates with the hub how to send/receive
            packets, either full or half duplex. The PRO/100B T4 adapter
            does not support auto-negotiating.
      
      Full duplex: The adapter sends and receives packets at the same
            time. This improves the performance of your adapter. Set
            duplex mode to full duplex only if you have a full duplex
            switch.
      
      Half duplex: The adapter performs one operation at a time. It
            either sends or receives.

A regular adapter can perform only one operation at a time (half-
duplexing). The PRO/100+ TX adapter has the ability to send and receive
packets at the same time (full-duplexing) at both 10 and 100 Mbps. The
PRO/100B T4 adapter supports full duplex only at 10 Mbps.  In order to
reap the benefits of full duplexing, you MUST have a full duplex switch.

The PRO/100+ adapter has the added ability to "talk" to the hub and
determine at which mode to communicate (either full or half duplex). This
is called auto-negotiation. You must have an auto-negotiating switch  to
get full duplex support with the Duplex Mode set to Auto. If you don't
have an auto-negotiating hub and want to run at full duplex, set Duplex
Mode to Full and then set the SPEED parameter to either 100 Mbps
(PRO/100+ TX) or 10 Mbps (PRO/100+ TX or T4).

Note: If you set duplex to Full, and leave Speed at Auto, the adapter
will run at 10 Mbps.


ADVANCED ADAPTER SETTINGS

Click the Advanced button in the Adapter Settings screen to change the
Advanced setting.
      
      Note: The defaults work correctly for most configurations. Please
            use caution when changing these parameters. Use the on-line
            help for additional information.


COALESCE BUFFERS
----------------

Recommended setting:  8


RECEIVE BUFFERS
---------------

Recommended setting:  32


TRANSMIT CONTROL BLOCKS
-----------------------

Recommended setting:  16


ADAPTIVE TRANSMIT THRESHOLD
---------------------------

Recommended setting:  On

This parameter dynamically optimizes the point at which early transmit
cycles will be executed.  This results in higher performance but may
generate an occasional underrun. To eliminate underruns, set it to OFF.


ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY
-------------------

Recommended setting:  On

Adaptive Technology customizes the PRO/100+ adapter to the respective
operating system by downloading microcode to the silicon.  This improves
performance and minimizes CPU utilization.


MAP REGISTERS
-------------

Recommended settings: 64
