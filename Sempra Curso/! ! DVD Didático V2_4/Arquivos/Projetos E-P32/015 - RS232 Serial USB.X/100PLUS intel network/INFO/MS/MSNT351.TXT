General Instructions
--------------------

After putting the adapter in the computer, you need to configure it
under Windows NT.

1  Double-click the Network icon in the Control Panel.

2  Click the Add Adapter button.

3  Do NOT select an Intel adapter from the list. Instead, scroll to the
   end of the list and select:
      
      <Other> Requires disk from manufacturer.

4  Click the Continue button.

5  Insert the Intel Configuration and Drivers Disk into your floppy drive
   and click OK.

6  Select "Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ PCI Adapter (TX or T4)" and click
   OK.

7  The Intel PROSet Setup program automatically scans computer resources
   and determines the settings assigned to your adapter.  It also adds an
   Intel PROSet icon to the Control Panel for future use of PROSet.

8  Click the Test button in the Intel PROSet program to run diagnostics.

   If you've just added the adapter, the network driver won't be active
   and the diagnostics will test the adapter and its connection to the
   network. If you're testing an adapter that's already been installed,
   the network driver will probably be active and the diagnostics will
   test the driver. This diagnostic tracks the driver's actual network
   activity.

9  Click OK to exit the test screen and return to the Intel PROSet main
   menu.

10 Click OK to accept the adapter's configuration and exit the PROSet
   Program.

11 Click OK in the Network Settings dialog.  Other configuration screens
   may appear.  Configure as desired.  When prompted, restart Windows NT.
      
      Note: The NDIS 3 miniport driver will automatically get installed
            in Windows NT 3.51.

12 Repeat the General Instruction process for installing additional
   adapters.


                                    
                            ADAPTER SETTINGS

There are two ways to run PROSet, which allows changing the adapter
settings.
   
   -  From the Control Panel double click on the Intel PROSet icon.
   
   -  From the Network Settings screen highlight the Intel PRO/100+
      adapter and click Configure.

   From the main Intel PROSet menu click the Change button to get to the
   Adapter Settings screen. The defaults work correctly for most
   configurations.


Network Speed
-------------
   
   Recommended setting:  Auto (default)

      This parameter lets the EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter know what
      speed to use on the Ethernet wire.  The choices are 10 Mbps, 100
      Mbps, and Auto.  In Auto mode, the adapter detects if its
      environment can support 100 Mbps speed. It then sets the speed to
      100 if it can, or 10 if it can't. If you are using a cross over
      cable connected to another adapter, set the speed to either 10 Mbps
      or 100 Mbps.
      
      Note: If the Duplex Mode is not set to Auto, then set the speed to
            either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps.




DUPLEX MODE (100BASE-T4 does not support full duplex)
-----------
   
   Recommended setting: Auto (PRO/100+ TX adapter only)

         Auto:  The adapter negotiates with the hub how to send/receive
         packets, either full or half duplex. The PRO/100B T4 adapter
         does not support auto-negotiating.

         Full duplex:  The adapter sends and receives packets at the same
         time. This improves the performance of your adapter. Set duplex
         mode to full duplex only if you have a full duplex switch.

         Half duplex:  The adapter performs one operation at a time. It
         either sends or receives.

      A regular adapter can perform only one operation at a time (half-
      duplexing). The PRO/100+ TX adapter has the ability to send and
      receive packets at the same time (full-duplexing) at both 10 and
      100 Mbps. The PRO/100T4 adapter only supports full duplex at 10
      Mbps.  In order to reap the benefits of full duplexing, you MUST
      have a full duplex hub.

      The PRO/100+ adapter has the added ability to "talk" to the hub and
      determine at which mode to communicate (either full or half
      duplex). This is called auto-negotiation. You must have an auto-
      negotiating switch to get full duplex support with the Duplex Mode
      set to Auto. If you don't have an auto-negotiating hub and want to
      run at full duplex, set Duplex Mode to Full and then set the SPEED
      parameter to either 100 Mbps (PRO/100+ TX) or 10 Mbps (PRO/100+ TX
      or T4).
      
      Note: If you set duplex to Full, and leave Speed at Auto, the
            adapter will run at 10 Mbps.



2  Click the Advanced button in the Adapter Settings screen to change the
   Advanced setting.
      
      Note: The defaults work correctly for most configurations. Please
            use caution when changing these parameters. Use the on-line
            help for additional information.


COALESCE BUFFERS
----------------
   
   Recommended setting:  8


RECEIVE BUFFERS
---------------
   
   Recommended setting:  16


TRANSMIT CONTROL BLOCKS
-----------------------
   
   Recommended setting:  16
   
   


ADAPTIVE TRANSMIT THRESHOLD
---------------------------

Recommended setting:  On

This parameter dynamically optimizes the point at which early transmit
cycles will be executed.  This results in higher performance but may
generate an occasional underrun. To eliminate underruns, set it to OFF.


ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY
-------------------

Recommended setting:  On

Adaptive Technology customizes the PRO/100+ adapter to the respective
operating system by downloading microcode to the silicon.  This improves
performance and minimizes CPU utilization.




MAP REGISTERS
-------------
   
   Recommended settings:
      PCI:    MapRegisters = 8 (default for NT 3.5)
      PCI:    MapRegisters = 64 (default for NT 3.51 or later)
