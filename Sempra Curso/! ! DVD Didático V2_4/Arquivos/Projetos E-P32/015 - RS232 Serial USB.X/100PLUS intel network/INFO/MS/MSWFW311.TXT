General Instructions
--------------------

NOTE: If you are running Novell NetWare* on this workstation, see the
      Novell NetWare section of Hints and Tips below before continuing
      with this installation.

1  Double-click the Network Setup icon in the Network Group.

2  If you are replacing a previous LAN adapter, click the Remove button
   to delete that adapter.

3  Click the Networks button. Select Install Microsoft Windows Network
   and click OK.
   
   Optional: To add Novell NetWare support to this workstation, click
         Other, then select Novell NetWare Shell 3.x if you are using
         NETX, or select Novell NetWare Shell 4.x if you use VLMs. Click
         OK.
   
   Optional: To share files and printers on this workstation, click the
         Sharing button, then click on OK.

4  Click the Drivers button.

5  Click the Add Adapter button.  Select Unlisted or Updated Network
   Adapter and click on OK.

6  Insert the adapter driver disk in drive A and specify the path A:\WFW
   for the location of the driver.

7  Select the Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ PCI adapter from the list box
   and click OK.

8  Specify the correct speed for your network.  If you are using the TX
   based adapter, specify the correct duplex mode. If you are unsure of
   the correct settings, contact you Network Administrator.
   
   Note: If you set the PRO/100+ TX adapter to FULL duplex and you are
         running at 100 Mbps, you must change your speed setting to 100.
   
   Note: These options will not come up if you already have the NetWare
         ODI driver installed.  These settings are set in the NET.CFG
         file.

9  The driver and default protocols will appear in the Network Drivers
   window. If you need to add or remove a protocol, do so here.

10 In the Network Drivers window, click Close.

11 In the Network Setup window, click OK.

12 In the Microsoft Windows Network Names window, enter a unique User
   Name, the name of your new or existing Workgroup, and a unique
   Computer Name for your workstation, then click OK.

13 Choose Yes To All when WFW asks if you want to replace the files
   currently installed with the versions you are installing now.

14 Insert the WFW disks WFW asks for. If prompted for the NetWare files,
   insert the Novell disk containing the drivers from the Novell file
   WINDR3.EXE. If prompted for the path of E100B.386, insert the Intel
   Configuration and Driver disk into a drive and for the path, type:
      A:\WFW.
   If prompted for the path of E100B.DOS, specify:
      A:\NDIS

15 When finished updating the files, WFW reports that it modified several
   files. Click on OK. WFW changes your last drive to P:.  If you want to
   change this setting, do so in your CONFIG.SYS file.  WFW also modifies
   your NET.CFG file (for NetWare users).  Check this file to make sure
   your frame types load in the correct order for your network.

16 When WFW prompts you to restart your computer for the changes to take
   effect, click on Restart Computer.

Hints and Tips
--------------

Novell NetWare

1. Before you begin to install driver support for WFW and Novell NetWare
   on the same workstation, you'll need these Novell NetWare files:
   NETWARE.DRV, NETWARE.HLP, NWPOPUP.EXE, VIPX.386, and VNETWARE.386.  To
   obtain these files, do one of the following:
   
   a  Download the self-extracting file WINDR3.EXE from Novell NetWire
      forum on CompuServe or Novell's FTP server on the internet
      (ftp.novell.com) or WWW
      (ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/updates/nwos/dsclnt12).
   
   b  Call Novell (1-800-NETWARE) to have the files sent to you.
   
   c  Contact a Novell NetWare dealer in your area.

2  Set up the workstation to connect to NetWare using the DOS ODI client
   driver.

3  Load the ODI driver and login to your NetWare server.

4  Start WFW and set up the driver for the EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter
   by following the instructions shown above. When the driver is chosen,
   WFW detects the ODI driver is already loaded and automatically
   installs the appropriate support.  Next to the adapter name in the
   Network Drivers window, you'll see [ODI/NDIS3] which indicates it
   recognized the ODI driver.

   Windows for Workgroups(WFW) creates the PROTOCOL.INI for you. This is
