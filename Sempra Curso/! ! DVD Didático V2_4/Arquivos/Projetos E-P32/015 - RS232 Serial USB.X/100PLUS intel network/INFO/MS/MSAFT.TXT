                                                           v1.03

Adapter Fault Tolerance installation notes for the
EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ adapter under Windows NT 4.0
============================================================

Overview
--------
Adapter Fault Tolerance provides link redundancy for two
EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapters.  When configured, there becomes 
a primary and secondary PRO/100+ adapter.  If the primary loses 
communication with the hub/switch, the secondary automatically 
takes over.  The secondary adapter will take over for such 
reasons as cable connection problems, switch or hub port
failure or adapter failure.  For more information on adapter
fault tolerance please see the readme file AFT.TXT.
     
     

Before you get started
----------------------

Before you can configure the PRO/100+ adapter for Adapter Fault 
Tolerance, you need to do the following:
      
      Install two PRO/100+ adapters in a Windows NT 4.0
      system as described in the readme file MSNT40.TXT. When
      installation is complete make sure you restart NT.
      
      If connecting to a hub, each PRO/100+ adapter in a team 
      will need to be connected to a separate port, which is
      in the same collision domain.  If connected to a switch,
      each PRO/100+ adapter in a team will have to be connected 
      to a separate port which is in the same network.


General Instructions
--------------------

1. Double-click on the Network Icon in the Control Panel.

2. Select the Adapter tab and double-click the "Intel
   EtherExpress PRO/100+ PCI Adapter" found in the Network
   Adapters list box.  This will launch the Intel PROSet utility.

3. Click on the Fault Tolerance button.

4. The Intel Adapter Fault Tolerance dialog box appears.  Click
   OK to continue. Adapter Fault Tolerance will automatically be
   installed.

5. To complete the configuration and installation, you will need
   to click the Close button in the Network dialog box.  This
   will update the bindings and allow you to assign the adapters
   to an Adapter Fault Tolerance team.

6. The dialog box Intel Adapter Fault Tolerance Configuration
   Manager is displayed during the binding process after the
   Close button is clicked.  Follow the directions on the screen
   to assign PRO/100+ adapters to the Fault Tolerance team.
   When done click OK to continue.
      
      Note: If you are creating more than one Adapter Fault
            Tolerance team, do not restart NT until all teams are
            created.

7. To add additional Adapter Fault Tolerance teams, repeat this 
   process starting at step 1.
