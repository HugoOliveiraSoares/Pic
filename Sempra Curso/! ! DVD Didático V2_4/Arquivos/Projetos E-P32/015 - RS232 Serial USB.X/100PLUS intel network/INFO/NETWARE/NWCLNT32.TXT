General Installation of Client 32 with Windows 95 using Intel's 32 bit
LAN driver
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisite:

1. Windows 95 operating system installed.

2. NetWare Client 32 for Windows 95 archive file and any patch files.

3. Access to the Windows 95 CD or CAB files, since the Client 32
   installation will ask for it.

4. Access to the latest drivers available from online services.


General Instructions
--------------------

1. If the Intel EtherExpress PCI adapter is being installed for the
   first time when Client 32 is being added, install the adapter
   hardware as described in the manual and go to step 2. If the adapter
   is already installed on the Windows 95 system, go to step 3.

2. When Windows 95 is restarting, it may display the message "Windows
   has found new hardware and is installing software for it". Select the
   option labeled "Do not install a driver (Windows will not prompt you
   again)" then click on OK.

3. Run the SETUP.EXE program for Client 32. It is located in the
   \ENGLISH subdirectory of the Client 32 software.

4. On the NetWare Client 32 Installation screen, make sure the "Upgrade
   NDIS driver to ODI, if available" box is checked if you are replacing
   the NDIS driver with the ODI.

5. When the Select Devices screen appears, highlight "Intel" under
   Manufacturers and select "Intel EtherExpress (TM) PRO/100+ PCI
   Adapter (ODI)" under Models. Click OK to install the driver.

6. On the Recommended NetWare Client 32 properties screen, set the
   appropriate settings for the version of NetWare you are using.

7. The Client 32 installation program will copy files. It may ask for
   the source of the Windows 95 installation files. Click OK and then
   enter the correct path to the files.

8. The Client 32 installation will finish, and you must reboot in order
   for the changes to become effective.

9. When Windows 95 reboots you may receive a DOS box message, "Command
   line parameter Prompt for E100B". Note the supported Slot value and
   select OK to continue. If you see a message "E100B.LAN did not remain
   resident ....", ignore it.

10.To prevent the Slot message from appearing each time Windows 95 is
   rebooted, right click the Network Neighborhood Icon. Click
   Properties. Highlight the "Intel EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ PCI
   Adapter(ODI)" and click Properties. Select the Advanced tab. Under
   Properties highlight Slot. Under Value, type in the slot value noted
   in step 9 and click OK twice. You will need to restart Windows 95.


Hints and Tips for Client 32 in Windows 95
------------------------------------------

1. If the Intel EtherExpress PCI adapter driver loads as an "ATI AT-2560
   Series PCI/100 Ethernet Adapter (ODI)", then the wrong driver has
   been installed. This can be easily corrected as follows:
   
   a) In the INF directory, which is located off the Windows 95
      directory, rename the file A2560.INF to A2560.BAK (or some other
      name that doesn't end in .INF).
   
   b) Go to Device Manager by right clicking on the Network Neighborhood
      Icon. Click Properties. Select the Device Manager tab. Highlight
      the "ATI AT-2560 Series PCI/100 Ethernet Adapter (ODI) and select
      remove. Next, highlight Novell ODINSUP and select remove. Restart
      Windows 95 after both entries have been removed.

2. Message - Module c:\novell\client32\e100b.lan did not remain
   resident: Occasionally on restarting Windows 95 after the Client 32
   installation, this NetWare Alert message appears. If you click on OK,
   another message says that "The hardware configuration conflicts
   E100B.LAN-NW-Adapter 0-Board-0". The ODINSUP device did not load
   properly (Device Manager doesn't show it under Network Adapters).
   Shut down the system and reboot. This action should load ODINSUP
   successfully.

3. PRO/10+ PCI adapter driver loads indicating it is a PRO/100+ adapter:
   If a problem occurs loading the driver, the driver may default to
   indicating it is a PRO/100+. This condition will not cause any
   problems since these two adapters use the same drivers. The only
   consideration to be aware of is if any advanced settings have to be
   made for the adapter. Speed is not a valid option for the PRO/10+
   PCI, and it will always operate at 10mbps. The Force Duplex option
   defaults to Auto-negotiate which isn't supported on the PRO/10+ PCI.
   It will operate in half duplex. If you need Full Duplex, set it
   specifically for Full.


General Installation of Client 32 with DOS/Windows 3.1x
-------------------------------------------------------

1. From the Novell NetWare Client 32 software, run INSTALL.EXE.

2. Select the NetWare Client 32 products you want to install from the on
   your workstation from the list:
      
      [X] NetWare Client 32 for DOS
      [X] NetWare Client 32 for Windows
      [ ] NetWare TCP/IP protocol stack
           [ ] NetWare IP (TCP/IP Required)
      [ ]Desktop SNMP
           [ ] HOSTMIB for SNMP (SNMP Required)

      Note - "NetWare Client 32 for DOS" and "NetWare Client 32 for
            Windows" are usually selected by default.

3. From the Customize Support for Windows menu, specify if you want to
   use multiple country codes or if you want to set the shared Windows
   path. The default for both of these is NO.

4. From the Select LAN Driver Type menu, select "32-bit LAN drivers".

5. From the 32-Bit Network Board Drivers menu, select

        "USER SPECIFIED 32 BIT DRIVER"

   Insert the driver diskette and type "A:\NWSERVER", select:

        "Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ LAN Adapter"

6. <OPTIONAL> Specify the following settings for the Intel EtherExpress
   LAN adapter:

          Parameter                       Default
          -------------                   -------
           Speed (100B only)               0 (auto detect)
           IOMAPMODE                       Memory Mapped
           Forceduplex                     0 (auto negotiate)
           Frame Type                      Ethernet_802.2
                                           Ethernet_802.3
      
      Note: The default settings will work for most installations. If
            you use multiple frame types, please see Hints and Tips
            section below.

7. From the Installation Configuration Summary, verify the default
   settings for Client 32 are correct, or modify as necessary.
      
      Modify AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS      [YES]
      
      Client Directory:       C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32
      Windows Directory:      C:\WINDOWS
      LAN driver type:        32-bit LAN drivers
      LAN driver:             Intel EtherExpress(TM) PCI Adapters

8. Novell NetWare will now copy the files to your workstations and
   modify the configuration files to match your selected configuration.


Hints and Tips
--------------

1. If you are using multiple frame types, you will get the following
   message when you load the driver:
      
      "Do you want to load another frame type for a previously loaded
      board?  Y/N "

   The way to avoid this is to add the slot number to the load line for
   the driver in the STARTNET.BAT (by default it is located in the
   \NOVELL\CLIENT32 directory). The only way to determine the slot
   number Novell is expecting is to put an invalid value on the load
   line. For example (and the load line should be all on one line):
      
           LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\E100B.LAN SPEED=0 IOMAPMODE=0
           FORCEDUPLEX=0 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2 SLOT=e

   When you next reboot, you will be prompted with the correct value.
   Modify the STARTNET.CFG again, and use that value. If the slot is not
   specified correctly, only the first frame type will load.

2. Check for a LASTDRIVE statement in the CONFIG.SYS file. You must have
   LASTDRIVE=Z in config.sys when using Client 32.

3. Verify that you have FIRST NETWORK DRIVE = F in the NET.CFG file
   under the NetWare DOS Requester section.
      
      NOTE: NET.CFG is position sensitive, so be careful to indent lines
            with one space or one tab as shown above in the example.

4. Verify that the EtherExpress adapter passes the diagnostics test by
   running SETUP.EXE on the EtherExpress driver disk. If the adapter
   fails diagnostics it will not function correctly running Client 32.

5. Using 16-bit ODI driver with Client 32 requires CLIENT32.NLM dated
   10/09/96 or later. The driver will not load with older versions.
