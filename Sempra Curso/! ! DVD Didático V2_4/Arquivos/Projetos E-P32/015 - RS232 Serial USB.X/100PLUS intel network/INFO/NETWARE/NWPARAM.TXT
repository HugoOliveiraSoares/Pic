   9 Server: NetWare Server Parameters
                                                                    v1.00

NetWare* Server Driver LOAD line parameters or Intel's 
EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ adapter
======================================================
  
   FORCEDUPLEX:

      Duplex modes:

      Auto-negotiate:  The adapter negotiates with the hub how to
      send/receive packets, either full or half duplex.  If unsuccessful
      at negotiating the duplex, the adapter defaults to half duplex. You
      must have an auto-negotiating hub (an Nway* switch) to get full
      duplex support with the FORCEDUPLEX parameter set to 0 (auto-
      negotiation).

      Full duplex:  The adapter sends and receives packets at the same
      time. This improves the performance of your adapter. Set duplex
      mode to full duplex ONLY if you have a switch that supports full
      duplex.

      Half duplex:  The adapter performs one operation at a time. It
      either sends or receives.
      
      Note: The PRO/100B T4 adapter does not support full duplex at 100
            Mbps, nor does the T4 adapter support Auto-Negotiation, or
            Nway.  The PRO/100+ TX adapter does not have any of these
            limitations.

      Syntax: FORCEDUPLEX=n

      Where n=0 auto-negotiate (PRO/100+ TX adapter only)
      
              1 half duplex
              2 full duplex
      
      Note: If the adapter is set to half or full duplex, set the SPEED
            parameter to either 10 or 100. (see SPEED below)

         Default:   auto-negotiation    (PRO/100+ TX adapter)
                    half duplex         (PRO/100B T4 adapter)

      Examples:

      PRO/100+ TX (100 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX=2 SPEED=100

      PRO/100+ TX (10 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX=2 SPEED=10

      PRO/100B T4 (100 Mbps full duplex): Not Supported

      PRO/100B T4 (10 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX=2 SPEED=10

   SLOT (required):

      For PCI adapters, SLOT is derived from bus number and device
      location as defined by the PCI specification. One way to determine
      the slot number is to load the driver from the command line. You'll
      be prompted with valid device number(s) for the adapter(s). Select
      one of them.

      Syntax:  SLOT=n     (n = 1,2,3,4,...)

   SPEED:

      Specifies the speed the driver uses. If you don't use this
      parameter, the driver automatically detects the network speed. If
      unable to autosense, the driver defaults to 10 Mbps.
      
      NOTE: You must set the SPEED parameter to either 10 or 100 if
            you're setting the FORCEDUPLEX parameter to either half or
            full.

         If you use this parameter, the driver operates at the specified
         speed instead of auto-detecting network speed.

         Syntax:  SPEED=n  (n = 10 or 100)

         Default: The adapter automatically senses speed.

   NODE:

      Specifies a local administered address (LAA) unique to each
      adapter.  Use this option to provide your own unique node address
      for the adapter.  The node address is a 12-digit hexadecimal
      number; the second digit must be one of the following digits: 2, 6,
      A, E.

      Syntax: NODE=xnxxxxxxxxxx

      n = 2, 6, A, E
      x = hexadecimal number

      Default: The adapter's assigned address
   

   FRAME:

      Indicates one of four valid frame types the system is transmitting
      and receiving.

         Syntax:  FRAME=n

         n = Ethernet_802.2
             Ethernet_802.3
             Ethernet_II
             Ethernet_SNAP

         Default: Ethernet_802.2

   TXTHRESHOLD:

      Represents the threshold for transmits from extender SRAM FIFO
      (output buffer).

         Syntax: TXTHRESHOLD=n (n = number of 8 bytes)

         For example, 16 represents 16x8 (or 128 bytes). In this case,
         the LAN controller transmits after copying 128 bytes from the
         host memory.

         Default: dynamically set

         The maximum number that you can specify is 200 (200x8=1600
         bytes) which ensures there will not be any underruns.
