                                                                    v1.05


NetWare* DOS ODI Client Driver installation notes for Intel's
EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ LAN Adapter
=============================================================

Location of Driver:  \DOS\E100BODI.COM


Quick Installation
------------------

Use the Automatic setup option in the SETUP utility on the Intel
Configuration and Drivers disk to quickly and easily install the ODI
driver using NETX. For workstations using VLM's, see the VLM client
section below.


Sample Configuration Files
--------------------------

AUTOEXEC.BAT:
   
   CD\NWCLIENT
   
   LSL
   
   E100BODI
   
   IPXODI
   
   NETX or VLM (VLM's for NetWare 4.1 or 3.12)

NET.CFG (for 802.3 clients - generally NetWare 3.11 servers):
   
   LINK DRIVER E100BODI
      FRAME ETHERNET_802.3

NET.CFG (for 802.2 clients - generally NetWare 3.12 and 4.1 servers):
   
   LINK DRIVER E100BODI
      FRAME ETHERNET_802.2
   
   NETWARE DOS REQUESTER
      FIRST NETWORK DRIVE = F


General Installation for NetWare 3.11/3.12 clients
------------------------------------------------------

All the files necessary to connect to the NetWare servers are supplied on
the Intel Configuration and Drivers disk. Newer versions of the shell
files (LSL.COM, IPXODI.COM, NETX.EXE) may be available from Novell on the
NetWire forum.

1  From the \DOS directory on the Intel Configuration and Driver disk,
   copy the following files onto your hard drive:  LSL.COM, E100BODI.COM,
   IPXODI.COM, NETX.EXE, and NET.CFG.

2  Add the commands to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file as shown above under the
   Sample Configuration Files section. Make sure you change to the
   subdirectory where the drivers are loaded before executing the files.
   In the example above, the drivers are located in the NWCLIENT
   subdirectory.

3  Edit the NET.CFG file per your requirements.

   If you don't know which frame type to load, type CONFIG at your file
   server console to see which frame type your file server is loading and
   load one of these frame types on the workstation.

   If you list two or more NetWare frame types in the NET.CFG, the first
   frame type will bind to the IPX protocol.

   The NET.CFG file should be in the same directory as the adapter
   driver.

   If you're running EMM386, make sure you are using v4.49 or later. It's
   the version that ships with DOS 6.22.

4  Reboot the computer and the drivers will load and connect you to the
   network.


General Instructions for NetWare 4.1/3.12 client with VLMs
----------------------------------------------------------

The installation of the NetWare 4.1 client software is much easier than
earlier versions. The installation procedure transfers files to a
specific directory on the workstation and creates or modifies existing
configuration files to fit your specific needs. The installation utility,
INSTALL.EXE, is located on NetWare's "Workstation for DOS" disk. The
install program is also located in \PUBLIC\CLIENT\DOSWIN on the server.
NetWare 3.12 does not automatically create this directory on the server
during installation.


Installation Procedure for NetWare 4.1/3.12 client with VLMs
-------------------------------------------------------------

1  Run INSTALL.EXE on the workstation you are configuring.  It can be
   found on the NetWare Workstation for DOS Disk.
         
         NOTE: INSTALL.EXE must be version 1.21 or greater

2  The NetWare Client Install program screen appears. You must complete
   each of the options as they are specific to your needs.

   Step #1:  Specifies the directory on the hard drive that you want to
   install the client software. The default directory is C:\NWCLIENT. You
   can specify another directory if you desire.

   Step #2:  Gives you the option to automatically update the CONFIG.SYS
   and the AUTOEXEC.BAT files or modify them at a later time manually.

   Step #3:  Installs Windows software for your system if your
   workstation supports Windows and asks you to specify the directory
   where Windows is located.  You will also have the option to customize
   for Windows.

   Step #4:  Gives you the option to configure your workstation for back-
   up by a NetWare server.

   Step #5:  Asks you to select a network driver and provide
   configuration options. It uses the specifications you select to create
   the NET.CFG file. Do NOT select a Driver from the list Novell
   provides, rather choose OTHER DRIVER and insert the Intel
   Configuration and Drivers disk.  Select the Intel EtherExpress
   PRO/100+ LAN Adapter.  There are four configurable settings:
   
      Frame Type: You must set the frame type to match the file server.
   
      Adapter Node Address: (optional) Changes the Node Address to a
      local address.

      Force Duplex Mode: (100BASE-T4 does not support full duplex)

           Sets the duplex mode of the driver.

                  0 = auto-negotiate  (default, PRO/100+ TX adapter)
                  1 = half duplex     (default, PRO/100B T4 adapter)
                  2 = full duplex
         
         NOTE: If Duplex Mode is set to full, the Line Speed defaults to
               10 Mbps. Also, the PRO/100B T4 adapter doesn't support
               auto-negotiate.
   
      Line Speed: (optional) Sets the line speed to either 10 or 100
      Mbps. If you don't use this parameter, the driver automatically
      detects the network speed.

   Step #6:  The install program copies the appropriate files to your
   hard drive. This is the final step.

3  Be sure to add LASTDRIVE=Z to your CONFIG.SYS file and FIRST NETWORK
   DRIVE=F in the NET.CFG file under the Netware DOS Requestor section.


Hints and tips
=====================================================================


NET.CFG optional parameters
---------------------------

FORCEDUPLEX:
      
      Note: The PRO/100B T4 adapter does not support full duplex at 100
            Mbps.  It does support full duplex at 10 Mbps.  The PRO/100+
            TX adapter supports full duplex at 10 and 100 Mbps.

         Syntax: FORCEDUPLEX n

         Where n=  0 auto-negotiate (PRO/100+ TX adapter only)
                   1 half duplex
                   2 full duplex
      
      Note: If the adapter is set to half or full duplex, set the SPEED
            parameter to either 10 or 100. (see SPEED below)

         Duplex modes:

         Auto-negotiate:  The adapter negotiates with the hub how to
         send/receive packets, either full or half duplex.  If
         unsuccessful at negotiating the duplex, the adapter defaults to
         half duplex.

      Note: The PRO/100B T4 adapter does not support auto-negotiate.

         Full duplex:  The adapter sends and receives packets at the same
         time. This improves the performance of your adapter. Set duplex
         mode to full duplex ONLY if you have a switch that supports full
         duplex.

         Half duplex:  The adapter performs one operation at a time. It
         either sends or receives.

         Default:   auto-negotiation    (PRO/100+ TX adapter)
                    half duplex         (PRO/100B T4 adapter)



         The PRO/100+ TX adapter has the added ability to "talk" to the
         hub and determine at which mode to communicate (either full or
         half duplex). This is called auto-negotiation. You must have an
         auto-negotiating hub (an Nway switch) to get full duplex support
         with the FORCEDUPLEX parameter set to 0 (auto-negotiation).

         Examples:

         PRO/100+ TX (100 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX 2  (Sets adapter to full duplex)
                  SPEED 100      (See SPEED parameter below)

         PRO/100+ TX (10 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX 2 (Sets adapter to full duplex)
                  SPEED 10

         PRO/100B T4 (100 Mbps full duplex): Not Supported

         PRO/100B T4 (10 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX 2 (Sets adapter to full duplex)
                  SPEED 10

      Note: Use auto-negotiate for full duplex support only when the
      adapter is connected to a switch that fully supports Nway     auto
      negotiation specification.



SPEED:   Specifies the speed the driver uses. If you don't use this
         parameter, the driver automatically detects the network speed.
         If no cable is attached, the driver defaults to 10 Mbps.
      
      Note: If you don't have a auto-negotiating hub and are forcing the
            duplex mode, specify the speed to either 10 or 100 using this
            parameter.

         If you use this parameter, the driver operates at the specified
         speed instead of automatically detecting network speed.

         Syntax:  SPEED n  (n = 10 or 100)

         Default: none, the adapter automatically senses speed.

TXTHRESHOLD: Represents the threshold for transmits from extender SRAM
         FIFO (output buffer).

         Syntax: TXTHRESHOLD n (n = number of 8 bytes). For example, 16
         represents 16x8 (or 128 bytes). In this case, the LAN controller
         transmits after copying 128 bytes from the host memory.

         Default: dynamically set

         The maximum number that you can specify is 200 (200x8=1600
         bytes) which ensures there will not be any underruns.



EARLYRECV: This parameter determines whether the driver enables early
         receives. Early receives allows a frame to start being processed
         before it is completely received in to host memory.  It boosts
         performance.

         Syntax: EARLYRECV n

         Where n=  0 disables early receives
                   1 enables early receives

         Default: early receives enabled



IRQMODE: This parameter enables or disables interrupt sharing mode of the
         driver. It has the capability to automatically select the
         enabled or disabled state depending on system configuration. If
         the IRQ assigned to the driver is not being shared with another
         device, then interrupt sharing is disabled.  If the IRQ assigned
         to the driver is being shared, then the interrupt sharing is
         enabled.

         Syntax: IRQMODE n

         Where n=  0 automatically selects interrupt sharing mode
                   1 interrupt sharing is disabled
                   2 interrupt sharing is enabled

         Default: 0 automatically selects



NODE ADDRESS:      Specifies a local administered address (LAA) unique to
         each adapter.  The node address is a 12-digit hexadecimal
         number; the second digit must be one of the following digits: 2,
         6, A, E.

         Syntax: NODE ADDRESS 02AA12345678

         02AA => LAA, 02 is set by the driver if not specified.
         00A0 => Typical Intel address (default)



FRAME:   Configures the adapter to process the valid NetWare Ethernet
         frame types.

         Syntax:  FRAME n

         n = Ethernet_802.2
             Ethernet_802.3
             Ethernet_II
             Ethernet_SNAP

         Default: Ethernet_802.2



PROTOCOL:     Indicates the standard protocol in use.

         Syntax: Protocol IPX E0 Ethernet_802.2

         Values: E0=Ethernet_802.2
                  0=Ethernet_802.3
               8137=Ethernet_II
               8137=Ethernet_SNAP

NetWare DOS Requester
=====================

FIRST NETWORK DRIVE: (Used only with the VLM.EXE). Indicates the first
         network drive available in the client system.
   
   Note: If you use FIRST NETWORK DRIVE, the last line in the CONFIG.SYS
         file must read: LASTDRIVE=Z
