   2 Server: NetWare 3.12 & 4.10 servers
                                                                    v1.07


NetWare* 3.12 and 4.10 Server Driver Installation Notes for Intel's
EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ adapter
===================================================================

Location of driver: \NWSERVER\E100B.LAN (ODI Assembly Specification
            version 3.3)

Location of NLMs:   Novell's automated services (LANDR9.EXE or greater)
      
      NOTE: LANDRx.EXE is a Novell archive that contains the latest
            server NLMs and support files. The x in LANDRx.EXE is subject
            to change with each new release of the archive.

These instructions are for use with the ODI Assembly Specification v3.30
NLMs. The \NWSERVER\E100B.LAN driver on this disk is written to this
specification. To load the driver on NetWare 4.10 or 3.12 requires
updated ETHERTSM, MSM and the new NBI.NLM. Obtain these files from
Novell's automated services.

   For NetWare 4.10:
   NBI.NLM             (ver 1.49, 08/30/96 or newer)
   MSM.NLM             (ver 3.18, 08/22/96 or newer)
   ETHERTSM.NLM        (ver 3.11, 07/03/96 or newer)

   For NetWare 3.12:
   NBI31X.NLM          (ver 1.49, 08/30/96 or newer)
   MSM31X.NLM          (ver 3.18, 08/22/96 or newer)
   ETHERTSM.NLM        (ver 3.11, 07/03/96 or newer)

Note: NBI.NLM (or NBI31X.NLM) must be loaded before MSM and ETHERTSM.
      NetWare 3.12 needs MSM31X.NLM renamed to MSM.NLM.



Sample load commands
====================
   
   LOAD C:<PATH>\E100B SLOT=n FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2
   BIND IPX TO E100B NET=xxxxxxxx


General Instructions
====================

1  Install NetWare 3.12 or 4.10 according to the NetWare instructions.

2  Copy the PRO/100+ server driver (\NWSERVER\E100B.LAN) and any updated
   NLMs, to the NetWare server's hard drive.

   If you can't log in to the server (before starting the server) copy
   the E100B.LAN driver from the \NWSERVER directory on the Intel
   Configuration and Drivers disk to the root directory of the server's
   hard drive.

   If you can log into the server, copy the driver to the SYSTEM
   subdirectory. If you do this, you won't need to specify a path on the
   load line. If you copy it to another directory, make sure the LOAD
   statement includes the correct path.

3  Start the server. At the server console, load NBI, MSM and ETHERTSM
   (for NetWare 3.12 load NBI31X, MSM31X and ETHERTSM) in this order.
   Next, load and bind the server driver as follows:
      
      LOAD C:<PATH>\E100B SLOT=x FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2
      BIND IPX TO E100B NET=xxxxxxxx

   Where:

   SLOT=x  Specifies the NBI (NetWare Bus Interface) slot number.
   Substitute x with the valid value for the adapter.  You will be
   prompted with the slot number(s) of installed PRO/100+ adapters.  The
   NBI numbers are different from the slot number indicated in the Intel
   SETUP.EXE utility.



   NET=xxxxxxxx is the unique network address for that LAN segment.

   The default frame type is 802.2.  If your workstation needs to use the
   802.3 frame type, see the section later in this document about using
   multiple frame types on one adapter.

4  Add the load and bind statements you need to the server's AUTOEXEC.NCF
   file so the EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter driver loads automatically
   each time the server starts.


Hints and tips
==============


1  If the error message MSGetPhysical is encountered:

   Upgrade the ETHERTSM.NLM and MSM31x.NLM and be sure to rename
   MSM31x.NLM to MSM.NLM


2  Installing multiple adapters:

   If you have multiple adapters in a single server, each adapter must
   have a different NET number and SLOT number. Also, you may want to
   name each adapter. For example:
      
      LOAD C:\E100B SLOT=3 NAME=LAN_A
      BIND IPX TO LAN_A NET=222
      LOAD C:\E100B SLOT=4 NAME=LAN_B
      BIND IPX TO LAN_B NET=333

3  If you have problems loading the driver on multiple adapters and the
   initialization fails due to "Insufficient RCBs," increase the number
   of buffers allocated to the server. Add the following to STARTUP.NCF:
      
      SET MINIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS = 100 (or larger)
      SET MAXIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS = 500 (or larger)

   The MINIMUM value you specify must be at least 30 times the number of
   EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapters in the computer.

   Recommended settings:
      
      1-3 adapters:  100
      4 adapters:    150

   The MAXIMUM you can specify depends on the amount of memory in the
   server, but it must be greater than the MINIMUM.


4  Installing one adapter with multiple frame types:

   When binding multiple frame types to one adapter, enter a LOAD and
   BIND statement for each frame type. Each LOAD statement uses the same
   SLOT number, but each BIND statement needs a unique network number.
   You must also include a name on each load line to avoid being prompted
   for the adapter to bind IPX to.
      
      Example:
      
      LOAD C:\E100B SLOT=3 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.3 NAME=LAN8023
      BIND IPX TO LAN8023 NET=77777
      LOAD C:\E100B SLOT=3 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2 NAME=LAN8022
      BIND IPX TO LAN8022 NET=88888


5  Optional LOAD line parameters.
        See readme NWPARAM.TXT titled NetWare Server Parameters for
        additional information.
