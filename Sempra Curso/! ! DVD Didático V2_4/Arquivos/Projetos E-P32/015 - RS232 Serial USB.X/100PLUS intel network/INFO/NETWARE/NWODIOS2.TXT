Introduction
============

To connect an OS/2 workstation to a NetWare* server, you must have the
latest version of the Novell NetWare Requester for OS/2 and the
EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter OS/2 ODI driver.

These installation instructions assume you're using the INSTALL program
that ships with Novell's OS/2 requester. For more information about OS/2
workstations, see the Novell manual, "NetWare Requester for OS/2."

NOTE: If you're running IBM OS/2 2.0, 2.1 or Warp, you must have the OS/2
      Requester version 2.01 or later.


General instructions
====================

1  Run Novell's INSTALL utility on the OS/2 requester disk and follow its
   instructions. If asked for the name of the network interface driver,
   enter E100BODI.SYS.

2  Choose the session support you need.  This is based on your
   configuration. See the NetWare Requester manual if you need help.

3  Save the configuration.

4  When asked for the path and filename for the driver, insert the Intel
   Configuration and Drivers disk in drive A and press enter.

5  After completing the installation section, choose CONFIGURATION from
   the main menu. Then choose THIS WORKSTATION. This allows you to modify
   the NET.CFG file. (NET.CFG must reside in the root directory.)
   
   Note: The default frame type for E100BODI.SYS is 802.2. If you're
         using the 802.3 frame type, you have to include a FRAME
         statement in the NET.CFG file. List the 802.3 FRAME type first
         in the NET.CFG file.
   
   


Hints and tips
==============


Verify driver loaded properly
-----------------------------

In the CONFIG.SYS file, add a "fake" device=xxx statement after the
E100BODI.SYS line. The screen stops and you can check for error messages.


Error message "not getting a connection ID"
-------------------------------------------

This OS/2 error message often appears when there is a frame type mismatch
or cable disconnect.


NET.CFG optional parameters
---------------------------

FORCEDUPLEX:
      
      Note: The PRO/100B T4 adapter does not support full duplex at 100
            Mbps.  It does at 10 Mbps.  The PRO/100+ TX adapter supports
            full duplex at 10 and 100 Mbps.

         Syntax: FORCEDUPLEX n

         Where n=0 auto-negotiate (PRO/100+ TX adapter only)
               1 half duplex
               2 full duplex
      
      Note: If the adapter is set to half or full duplex, set the SPEED
            parameter to either 10 or 100. (see SPEED below)

         Duplex modes:

         Auto-negotiate:  The adapter negotiates with the hub how to
         send/receive packets, either full or half duplex.  If
         unsuccessful at negotiating the duplex, the adapter defaults to
         half duplex.

      Note: The PRO/100B T4 adapter does not support auto-negotiate.

         Full duplex:  The adapter sends and receives packets at the same
         time. This improves the performance of your adapter. Set duplex
         mode to full duplex ONLY if you have a switch that supports full
         duplex.

         Half duplex:  The adapter performs one operation at a time. It
         either sends or receives.

         Default: auto-negotiation     (PRO/100+ TX adapter)
         half duplex         (PRO/100B T4 adapter)

         The PRO/100+ TX adapter has the added ability to "talk" to the
         hub and determine at which mode to communicate (either full or
         half duplex). This is called auto-negotiation. You must have an
         auto-negotiating hub (an Nway switch) to get full duplex support
         with the FORCEDUPLEX parameter set to 0 (auto-negotiation).

         Examples:

         PRO/100+ TX (100 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX 2  (Sets adapter to full duplex)
                  SPEED 100      (See SPEED parameter below)

         PRO/100+ TX (10 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX 2 (Sets adapter to full duplex)
                  SPEED 10

         PRO/100B T4 (100 Mbps full duplex): Not Supported

         PRO/100B T4 (10 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX 2 (Sets adapter to full duplex)
                  SPEED 10
      
      Note: Use auto-negotiate for full duplex support only when the
            adapter is connected to a switch that fully supports Nway
            auto negotiation specification.

SLOT:    For PCI adapters, SLOT is derived from bus number and device
         location as defined by the PCI specification. One way to
         determine the slot number is to run setup.exe from DOS.

         Syntax:  SLOT n     (n = 1,2,3,4,...)

SPEED:   Specifies the speed the driver uses. If you don't use this
         parameter, the driver automatically detects the network speed.
         If no cable is attached, the driver defaults to 10 Mbps.

         If you don't have a auto-negotiating hub and are configuring the
         adapter for full or half duplex support, specify the speed to
         either 10 or 100 Mbps using this parameter.

         If you use this parameter, the driver operates at the specified
         speed instead of automatically detecting network speed.

         Syntax:  SPEED n  (n = 10 or 100)

         Default: none, the adapter automatically senses speed
      
      NOTE: Set the SPEED parameter to either 10 or 100 if you're setting
            the FORCEDUPLEX parameter to either 1 or 2 (half or full).



TXTHRESHOLD: Represents the threshold for transmits from extender SRAM
         FIFO (output buffer).

         Syntax: TXTHRESHOLD n  (n = number of 8 bytes)
         

         For example, 16 represents 16x8 (or 128 bytes). In this case,
         the LAN controller transmits after copying 128 bytes from the
         host memory to the SRAM FIFO.

         Default: dynamic

         The maximum number that you can specify is 200 (200x8=1600
         bytes).

NODE ADDRESS:      Specifies a local administered address (LAA) unique to
         each adapter.  The node address is a 12-digit hexadecimal
         number; the second digit must be one of the following digits: 2,
         6, A, E.

              Syntax: NODE ADDRESS 02A0C9345678

                 02 => Locally administered address
                 00 => Typical Intel address (default)

FRAME:   Configures the adapter to process the four valid NetWare
         Ethernet frame types.

         Syntax:  FRAME n

                  n = Ethernet_802.2
                      Ethernet_802.3
                      Ethernet_II
                      Ethernet_SNAP

         Default: Ethernet_802.2

PROTOCOL:     Indicates the standard protocol in use.

         Syntax: Protocol ipx e0 Ethernet_802.2

         Values: e0=Ethernet_802.2
                  0=Ethernet_802.3
               8137=Ethernet_II
               8137=Ethernet_SNAP
