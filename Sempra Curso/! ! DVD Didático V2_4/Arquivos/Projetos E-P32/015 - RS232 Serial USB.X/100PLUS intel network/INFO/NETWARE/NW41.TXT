                                                                 v1.08
NetWare* 4.11 Server Driver Installation Notes for Intel's
EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ adapter
==========================================================

Location of driver: \NWSERVER\E100B.LAN (ODI Assembly Specification
                    version 3.3.  An earlier version of this driver
                    ships with NetWare 4.11)

Location of NLM's:  Ships with NetWare 4.11, updates also available in
                    LANDRx.EXE (where x is the latest version) on
                    Novell's automated services.
      
      NOTE: For NetWare 4.10 installation instructions please see
            NW312.TXT.


Sample load commands
====================
   
   LOAD C:<PATH>\E100B SLOT=n FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2
   BIND IPX TO E100B NET=xxxxxxxx


General Instructions
====================

1  If you're doing a NEW installation of NetWare 4.11, install it
   according to the NetWare installation instructions. The
   installation process will automatically detect the PRO/100+. A
   message appears indicating that it detected the hardware but found
   more than one driver supporting it. The hardware ID you'll see
   displayed for the PRO/100+ is PCI.8086.1229.XXXX.XXXX.XX. Press
   Enter for a list of drivers. DO NOT select the Intel EtherExpress
   PRO/100 LAN Adapter from the list.  Press F-10 to install the newer
   driver from the Intel Configuration and Driver disk.  Choose the
   Select additional or Modify Selected Disk/LAN drivers.  Follow the
   installation screens to complete the installation of the driver.
   The necessary load and bind parameters will automatically be added
   to the AUTOEXEC.NCF file with Ethernet_802.2 and Ethernet_802.3
   bound to the adapter.  If you need to change the frame types for
   your network, edit the AUTOEXEC.NCF after the installation is
   completed.
      
      Note: A good way to determine the slot number is to let the
            driver load without a slot number.  NetWare will prompt
            with valid slot number(s) for the adapter(s). Select one
            of them.

2  For servers already installed with NetWare 4.11, start the server.
   At the server console, issue the load and bind statement(s) in this
   order:
   
        LOAD C:<PATH>\E100B SLOT=n FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2
        BIND IPX TO E100B NET=xxxxxxxx
      
      Note: If MSM and ETHERTSM Nlms aren't loaded, they'll
            automatically load before the driver.

   Where:

   SLOT=n  specifies the NBI (NetWare Bus Interface) slot number.
   Substitute n with the valid value for the adapter.  You will be
   prompted with the slot numbers of installed PRO/100+ adapters. The
   NBI slot number is different from the slot number indicated in the
   Intel SETUP.EXE utility.

   NET=xxxxxxxx  is the unique network address for that LAN segment.

   The default frame type is 802.2.  If your workstations need to use
   the 802.3 frame type, see the section later in this document about
   using multiple frame types on one adapter.

3  Add the load and bind statements you need to the server's
   AUTOEXEC.NCF file so the EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter driver loads
   automatically each time the server starts.


Hints and tips
==============


1  Installing multiple adapters:

   If you have multiple adapters in a single server, each adapter must
   have a different NET number and SLOT number. Also, you may want to
   name each adapter. For example:
      
      LOAD C:\E100B SLOT=10001 NAME=LAN_A
      BIND IPX TO LAN_A NET=1234
      LOAD C:\E100B SLOT=10003 NAME=LAN_B
      BIND IPX TO LAN_B NET=5678

   If you have problems loading the driver on multiple adapters and
   the initialization fails due to "Insufficient RCBs," increase the
   number of buffers allocated to the server. Add the following to
   STARTUP.NCF:
      
      SET MINIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS = 100 (or larger)
      SET MAXIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS = 500 (or larger)

   The MINIMUM value you specify must be at least 30 times the number
   of EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapters in the computer.

   Recommended settings:
      
      1-3 adapters:  100
      4 adapters:    150

   The MAXIMUM you can specify depends on the amount of memory in the
   server.  It must be greater than the MINIMUM.


2  Installing one adapter with multiple frame types:

   When binding multiple frame types to one adapter, enter a LOAD and
   BIND statement for each frame type. Each LOAD statement uses the
   same SLOT number, but each BIND statement needs a unique network
   number. You must also include a name on each load line to avoid
   being prompted for the adapter to bind IPX to.
      
      Example:
      
      LOAD C:\E100B SLOT=10003 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.3 NAME=LAN8023
      BIND IPX TO LAN8023 NET=77777
      LOAD C:\E100B SLOT=10003 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2 NAME=LAN8022
      BIND IPX TO LAN8022 NET=88888


3  LOAD line parameters:

   SLOT:(required parameter)

      For PCI adapters, SLOT is derived from bus number and device
      location. Novell determines the slot number for PCI and Plug and
      Play adapters using NBI. These slot numbers are different then
      the slot numbers used with other drivers or the Intel SETUP
      utility. One way to determine the slot number is to load the
      driver from the command line. You'll be prompted with valid
      device number(s) for the adapter(s). Select one of them.

          Syntax:  SLOT=n     (n = 10001,10002,10005...)

      If you have multiple PCI adapters of the same type installed and
      need to match the physical adapter to the associated slot
      number, use the NetWare server command CONFIG.  The information
      shown through this utility shows the NBI slot number and the
      adapter's Ethernet address.  Match the Ethernet address shown
      here to the address printed on the adapter.

   FORCEDUPLEX:

      Duplex modes:

      Auto-negotiate:  The adapter negotiates with the hub how to
      send/receive packets, either full or half duplex.  If
      unsuccessful at negotiating the duplex, the adapter defaults to
      half duplex. You must have an auto-negotiating switch to get
      full duplex support with the FORCEDUPLEX parameter set to 0
      (auto-negotiation).

      Full duplex:  The adapter sends and receives packets at the same
      time. This improves the performance of your adapter. Set duplex
      mode to full duplex ONLY if you have a switch that supports full
      duplex.

      Half duplex:  The adapter performs one operation at a time. It
      either sends or receives.
      
      Note: The PRO/100B T4 adapter does not support full duplex at
            100 Mbps, nor does the T4 adapter support Auto-
            Negotiation.  The PRO/100+ TX adapter does not have any of
            these limitations.

      Syntax: FORCEDUPLEX=n

      Where n=0 auto-negotiate (PRO/100+ TX adapter only)
              1 half duplex
              2 full duplex
      
      Note: If the adapter is set to half or full duplex, set the
            SPEED parameter to either 10 or 100. (see SPEED below)

         Default:   auto-negotiation    (PRO/100+ TX adapter)
                    half duplex         (PRO/100B T4 adapter)

      Examples:

      PRO/100+ TX (100 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX=2 SPEED=100

      PRO/100+ TX (10 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX=2 SPEED=10

      PRO/100B T4 (100 Mbps full duplex): Not Supported

      PRO/100B T4 (10 Mbps full duplex):
                  FORCEDUPLEX=2 SPEED=10


   SPEED:

      Specifies the speed the driver uses. If you don't use this
      parameter, the driver automatically detects the network speed.
      If no cable is attached, the driver defaults to 10 Mbps.
      
      NOTE: You must set the SPEED parameter to either 10 or 100 if
            you're setting the FORCEDUPLEX parameter to either half or
            full.

      If you use this parameter, the driver operates at the specified
      speed instead of auto-detecting network speed.

      Syntax:  SPEED=n  (n = 10 or 100)

      Default: none, the adapter automatically senses speed.



   NODE:

      Specifies a local administered address (LAA) unique to each
      adapter.  Use this option to provide your own unique node
      address for the adapter.  The node address is a 12-digit
      hexadecimal number; the second digit must be one of the
      following digits: 2, 6, A, E.

      Syntax: NODE=xnxxxxxxxxxx

      n = 2, 6, A, E
      x = hexadecimal number

      Default: The adapter's assigned address





   FRAME:

      Configures the adapter to process one of the four valid NetWare
      Ethernet frame types.

      Syntax:  FRAME=n

      n = Ethernet_802.2
          Ethernet_802.3
          Ethernet_II
          Ethernet_SNAP

      Default: Ethernet_802.2



   TXTHRESHOLD:

      Represents the threshold for transmits from extended SRAM FIFO.

         Syntax: TXTHRESHOLD=n (n = number of 8 bytes)

         For example, 16 represents 16x8 (or 128 bytes). In this case,
         the LAN controller transmits after copying 128 bytes from the
         host memory.

         Default: dynamically set

      The maximum number you can specify is 200 (200x8=1600 bytes)
      which ensures there will not be any underruns.
