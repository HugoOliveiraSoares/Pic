                                                                    v1.05


Banyan* NDIS workstation installation notes for Intel's EtherExpress(TM)
PRO/100+ PCI LAN adapter
========================================================================

Location of Driver:  \NDIS\E100B.DOS


Sample Configuration Files
--------------------------

CONFIG.SYS (will contain):
   
   DEVICE=C:\BAN\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\BAN
   DEVICE=C:\BAN\E100B.DOS

PROTOCOL.INI:
   
   [E100B_NIF]
      Drivername = E100B$


General Installation
--------------------

1  The EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter uses an NDIS 2.0.1 driver to connect
   to a Banyan server. If you have an NDIS client disk prepared, skip to
   step #6.

2  To create an NDIS client disk, run PCCOPY (located on the Z drive of
   the Banyan server).

3  Choose PC Configuration Software and/or LAN driver, then select NDIS
   Ethernet and PCCONFIG.

4  Choose the appropriate DOS redirector. For example, REDIRALL for all
   versions of DOS.

5  Specify the directory you want the client software copied to. The
   default is A:\.

6  On the client you're setting up, copy the NDIS client software to a
   directory on the hard drive.

7  Run Banyan's PCCONFIG program.

8  Select Network Card Settings and page down to select the NDIS Ethernet
   option.

9  Specify E100B_NIF as the PROTOCOL.INI bindings parameter.

10 Select Login Environment Settings, then select Default Communications
   Driver. Page down to select the NDIS Ethernet option.

11 Save the settings and exit PCCONFIG.

12 Copy the PROTOCOL.INI and E100B.DOS files located in the NDIS
   subdirectory on the Intel Configuration and Driver disk to the BAN
   subdirectory or other directory where Banyan client files are located.
   Modify the PROTOCOL.INI file to make sure the file contains the line
   [E100B_NIF] above the DRIVERNAME=E100B$ line.

13 Add the lines to your CONFIG.SYS file as shown in the Sample
   Configuration Files section above.

14 Reboot and run BAN to attach to the Banyan server.


Hints and Tips
--------------

1  Error Message with PRO0025E:

   This type of message occurs when the driver attempts to bind to the
   protocol manager. It usually indicates there's a syntax or other error
   in the PROTOCOL.INI file. Review the file carefully for errors. Also,
   verify parameters entered in PCCONFIG. For additional information, see
   NDISBAN.DOC which is part of the NDIS Banyan client software.

2  Make sure your NDISBAN.COM is dated April 1994 or later. Earlier
   versions may not work properly.

3  Parameters for the PROTOCOL.INI file:
   
   DRIVERNAME: (required) If you have a single adapter, use the syntax in
      the Sample Configuration file section.  If you are installing
      multiple adapters, each adapter must have a unique driver name.
      Additional instances of the driver would be referenced by
      DRIVERNAME=E100Bx$, where "x" is a unique number 2 through 9.
   
   SPEED: (optional; parameters are [Auto / 10 / 100]) The parameter
      disables Auto-Speed Detect and causes the adapter to function at
      the speed indicated. If the FORCEDUPLEX parameter is assigned to
      either 1 or 2, the SPEED parameter is required because auto-speed
      sensing is disabled if the duplex mode is forced. Auto-negotiate
      devices cannot detect speed changes in this configuration until the
      driver is reloaded.[Example: SPEED=100]
   
   FORCEDUPLEX: Full duplex and auto-negotiate capabilities vary between
      the PRO/100 TX and the PRO/100 T4 adapters.

         EtherExpress PRO/100+ TX adapter: Supports auto-negotiate, full
         and half duplex at 10 or 100 Mbps.

         EtherExpress PRO/100B T4 adapter: Supports full and half duplex
         at 10 Mbps; supports only half duplex at 100 Mbps.  Auto-
         negotiate is not a valid option at either speed.
   
      This parameter disables Auto-Negotiate capability and forces the
      adapter to operate in Half or Full Duplex mode. The SPEED parameter
      must be specified and must be valid if the default of Auto-
      negotiate is changed. Options for FORCEDUPLEX are Auto (for auto-
      negotiate), 1 (for half), 2 (for full). [Example: FORCEDUPLEX = 2]
   
   SLOT: (required for multiple adapters) This parameter is optional if
      only one adapter is present.  If it is specified but is incorrect,
      a message indicates that the value doesn't match the configuration
      but the driver finds the adapter and loads anyway.
   
      This parameter is required if more than one adapter is present in
      either one bus or multiple PCI buses of a system. The parameter
      tells the driver which adapter it controls. The SLOT number is the
      encoded value of the PCI adapter's device location. To determine
      the slot number, load the driver with only the DRIVERNAME parameter
      specified.  The driver reports all the slots that have PCI
      adapter(s) installed. You can determine which card is in which slot
      by using SETUP.EXE and matching the Ethernet addresses of the
      adapter to the device number specified in View Configuration.
      [Example: SLOT=0x1C]
   
   NODE: (optional) This value sets the adapter's Individual Address,
      overriding the value read from the adapter EEprom. The address must
      consist of 12 hexadecimal digits, enclosed in double quotes.  The
      value can not be all zeros. The value can not have the Multicast
      bit set. So, use only the hexadecimal digits 2, 6, A, or E as the
      second digit of the twelve required in the NODE ADDRESS parameter.
      Use any hexadecimal digits in all other positions.[Example: NODE =
      "02AA00123456"]
