LANtastic* 6.0 installation notes for the Intel EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+
PCI LAN adapter
=========================================================================

Location of driver:     \NDIS\E100B.DOS


General Instructions (sample configuration files below)
-------------------------------------------------------

The installation procedure transfers files to a specific directory on the
workstation and creates or modifies existing configuration files to fit
your specific needs.  The installation utility, INSTALL.EXE, is located
on LANtastic Network Software Disk 1.

1  Run INSTALL.EXE from Disk 1.

2  The LANtastic Install program screen appears. You must complete each
   of the questions. These options are specific to your needs.
   
   1  Asks for a unique computer name.
   
   2  Asks you to select the drive that you want LANtastic to be
      installed on. The default is Drive C:.
   
   3  Asks you to specify a directory where you want the LANtastic files
      to be installed. The default is \LANTASTI.
   
   4  Asks if you want to share your computer's drives or printers.
   
   5  Asks you to select the maximum number of connected computers.
   
   6  Prompts you to select any other LANtastic features that you may
      want to install.
   
   7  Summarizes the options you selected. If it looks correct, continue
      with the installation.
   
   8  Prompts you to select a network adapter to run your LANtastic
      software on. From the list of adapters, select "NDIS SUPPORT FOR
      NETWORK ADAPTERS".
   
   9  Asks you to insert the manufacturer's driver diskette. Insert the
      Intel Configuration and Drivers diskette into drive A: and specify
      the source path for driver files as A:\NDIS.
   
   10 Asks if you want to Set Up Permanent Drive or Printer Connections.
   
   11 Summarizes the options you selected. If they are correct, choose
      Perform the Installation and LANtastic will install the files.


Hints and Tips
==============

Below are sample CONFIG.SYS, STARTNET.BAT and PROTOCOL.INI files. These
are the three files with EtherExpress PRO/100+ configuration options that
the Install program creates. For details on PROTOCOL.INI parameters, see
the end of this document.

Sample C:\LANTASTI\PROTOCOL.INI file
------------------------------------

;PROTOCOL.INI for LANtastic Version 6.00

;--- using Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter

[PROTMAN]
   DRIVERNAME = PROTMAN$
   DYNAMIC = YES

; PROTOCOL.INI section for the Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter.

[E100B_NIF]
   DRIVERNAME = E100B$



Parameters for the PROTOCOL.INI file are listed below.
   
   DRIVERNAME: (required) If you have a single adapter, use the syntax in
      the Sample Configuration file section.  If you are installing
      multiple adapters, each adapter must have a unique driver name.
      Additional instances of the driver would be referenced by
      DRIVERNAME=E100Bx$, where "x" is a unique number 2 through 9.
   
   SPEED: (optional; parameters are [Auto / 10 / 100]) The parameter
      disables Auto-Speed Detect and causes the adapter to function at
      the speed indicated. If the FORCEDUPLEX parameter is assigned to
      either 1 or 2, the SPEED parameter is required because auto-speed
      sensing is disabled if the duplex mode is forced. Auto-negotiate
      devices cannot detect speed changes in this configuration until the
      driver is reloaded.[Example: SPEED=100]
   
   FORCEDUPLEX: Full duplex and auto-negotiate capabilities vary between
      the PRO/100 TX and the PRO/100 T4 adapters.

         EtherExpress PRO/100+ TX adapter: Supports auto-negotiate, full
         and half duplex at 10 or 100 Mbps.

         EtherExpress PRO/100B T4 adapter: Supports full and half duplex
         at 10 Mbps; supports only half duplex at 100 Mbps.  Auto-
         negotiate is not a valid option at either speed.
   
      This parameter disables Auto-Negotiate capability and forces the
      adapter to operate in Half or Full Duplex mode. The SPEED parameter
      must be specified and must be valid if the default of Auto-
      negotiate is changed. Options for FORCEDUPLEX are Auto (for auto-
      negotiate), 1 (for half), 2 (for full). [Example: FORCEDUPLEX = 2]
   
   SLOT: (required for multiple adapters) This parameter is optional if
      only one adapter is present.  If it is specified but is incorrect,
      a message indicates that the value doesn't match the configuration
      but the driver finds the adapter and loads anyway.
   
      This parameter is required if more than one adapter is present in
      either one bus or multiple PCI buses of a system. The parameter
      tells the driver which adapter it controls. The SLOT number is the
      encoded value of the PCI adapter's device location. To determine
      the slot number, load the driver with only the DRIVERNAME parameter
      specified.  The driver reports all the slots that have PCI
      adapter(s) installed. You can determine which card is in which slot
      by using SETUP.EXE and matching the Ethernet addresses of the
      adapter to the device number specified in View Configuration.
      [Example: SLOT=0x1C]
   
   NODE: (optional) This value sets the adapter's Individual Address,
      overriding the value read from the adapter EEprom. The address must
      consist of 12 hexadecimal digits, enclosed in double quotes.  The
      value can not be all zeros. The value can not have the Multicast
      bit set. So, use only the hexadecimal digits 2, 6, A, or E as the
      second digit of the twelve required in the NODE ADDRESS parameter.
      Use any hexadecimal digits in all other positions.[Example: NODE =
      "02AA00123456"]
