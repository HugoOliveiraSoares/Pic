busmaster operation during power-up.  This computer didn't.

The EtherExpress PRO adapter Setup program and all PRO/100+
drivers take care of this problem for you in most cases.

However, if you have problems with your adapter failing
diagnostic tests, move the adapter to another slot in your
computer and try the test again.

If you still have problems, contact your network services
supplier.
