Diagnostic LEDs for Intel EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ TX PCI
adapters

LNK:
----
   
   Indicates the adapter is connected to a hub or switch and
   is receiving link pulses. If the LNK light isn't on,
   check all connections at the adapter and the hub. Make
   sure the hub is transmitting at the correct speed and the
   drivers are loaded.
   
   Also, make sure you have the correct wiring configuration
   for the adapter to the hub connection. Some hubs require
   a crossover cable rather than a straight-through cable.
   
   Note that this LED will be on when running the
   diagnostics loopback test without a cable attached to the
   adapter.


ACT:
----

Indicates read/write activity on the network. It doesn't
always mean there is activity on this adapter. If the ACT
light isn't on, make sure the hub and network are operating
and the drivers are loaded.


100:
----

Indicates 100 Mbps when on, and 10 Mbps when off.

Note that 100 LED may stay on if link is broken during
activity.
