Adapter Fault Tolerance Overview
================================

Adapter Fault Tolerance (AFT) is a simple, effective, and
fail-safe approach to increase the reliability of server
connections. AFT gives you the ability to set up link
recovery to the server adapter in case of a cable, port, or
network interface card failure. By assigning two Intel
EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ adapters as a team, AFT enables
you to maintain uninterrupted network performance.

AFT is implemented with two PRO/100+ adapters: a primary
adapter and a backup, or secondary, adapter. During normal
operation, the backup will have transmit disabled. If the
link to the primary adapter fails, the link to the backup
adapter automatically takes over.
   
   Notes:
   
   This feature is currently available for NetWare* 4.1x and
   Windows NT* 4.0 only.
