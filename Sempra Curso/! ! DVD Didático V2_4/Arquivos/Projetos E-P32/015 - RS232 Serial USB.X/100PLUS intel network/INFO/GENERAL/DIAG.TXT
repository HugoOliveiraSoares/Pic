Running diagnostics on Intel EtherExpress(TM) PRO/100+ TX
adapters
============================================================

Intel's diagnostic software lets you test the adapter to see
if there are any problems with the adapter hardware, the
cabling, or the network.

It's a good idea to run diagnostics every time you install
an adapter.

You can also use diagnostics to isolate problems during
troubleshooting.


DOS and Windows* 3.1 users
==========================

NOTE: If you want to test the adapter with a responder on
the network, skip to the procedure after step 5.

1  Restart your computer without loading any EtherExpress
   PRO/100+ adapter network drivers.
   
   NOTE: If network drivers are installed, you must first
   unload or disable them or reboot your computer without
   loading them.

2  Disconnect the network cable from the adapter under test.
   (Leaving the cable connected will cause the test to
   fail.)

3  Insert the Intel Configuration and Drivers disk into a
   drive, switch to that drive, and at the DOS prompt, type
   SETUP <Enter>

4  From the Board Menu, select the adapter you want to test.
   (If you have only one adapter installed, the Board Menu
   doesn't appear.)

5  From the Main Menu, select Test Adapter. Then select Test
   Adapter again. The program runs a series of tests that
   make sure the adapter is functioning properly.

6  Repeat steps 2 - 5 for each adapter installed in the
   computer.


To test the adapter with a responder on the network
---------------------------------------------------

1  Go to a computer on the same network segment with an
   EtherExpress 16 ISA, Flash32, EtherExpress PRO, PRO/100+,
   PRO/100 PCI, PRO/100B PCI, or PRO/10+ PCI adapter
   installed.
   
   NOTE: if you disconnected the network cable from a
   PRO/100+ TX PCI adapter in the preceding test, reconnect
   it now.

2  If this computer already has EtherExpress adapter network
   drivers installed, restart the computer without loading
   them. For example, if the drivers are loaded from the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file, add REM in front of each line that
   loads a driver. Or, boot from a DOS disk.

3  Run the diagnostics program for the adapter that's
   installed in the computer (such as SoftSet, SETUP, or
   PROSet).

4  From the Main menu, select the command for testing the
   adapter, then select Set up as diagnostics responder.

5  Return to the computer you want to test. Run SETUP,
   choose Test adapter, and then choose Continuous Network
   test.


Windows NT* users
=================

If you have not already installed new drivers from the Intel
Configuration and Drivers disk:

1  Double-click the Network icon in the Control Panel.

2  Click the Add Adapter button.

3  Don't select an Intel adapter from the list.
   
   For NT 3.51, scroll to the end of the list (NT 3.51) and
   select: <Other> Requires disk from manufacturer.
   
   For NT 4.0, click Have Disk.

4  Insert the Intel Configuration and Drivers disk into your
   floppy drive and click OK. In NT 4.0 click Close to
   complete process.
   
   The drivers are copied and the PROSet program launches.

5  Click the Test button.
   
   If you've just added the adapter, the network driver
   won't be active and the diagnostics will test the adapter
   and its connection to the network.
   
   If you're testing an adapter that's already been
   installed, the network driver will probably be active and
   the diagnostics will test the driver. This diagnostic
   tracks the driver's actual network activity.
   
   If you have already installed the drivers:
   
   1  For NT 3.51: Double-click the Intel PROSet icon in the
      Control Panel.
      
      For NT 4.0: Open the Network Control panel, go to the
      Adapters tab, select an adapter and click Properties.
   
   2  Click Test on the window that appears.
      
      If you have more than one adapter, first select the
      adapter from the displayed list.
      
      If you've just added the adapter, the network driver
      won't be active and the diagnostics will test the
      adapter and its connection to the network.
      
      If you're testing an adapter that's already been
      installed, the network driver will probably be active
      and the diagnostics will test the driver. This
      diagnostic tracks the driver's actual network
      activity.


Windows 95 users
================

Use PROSet to test the adapter:

1  Double-click the Intel PROSet icon in the Control Panel
   (if the icon is not present, you may need to install
   PROSet; see installation instructions below).

2  Click Test on the window that appears.
   
   If you have more than one adapter, first select the
   adapter from the displayed list.
   
   When using the Intel PRO adapter setup program, you have
   two testing options:
   
   A. Test the adapter and driver together:
   
   The adapter and driver test doesn't require you to unload
   the NDIS driver.
   
   a.  Click Test NDIS.
   
   b.  When the test is complete, click OK to exit.
   
   
   
   B.   Test the adapter hardware:
   
   The adapter hardware test unloads the NDIS driver.
   
   a.  Click Unload NDIS.
   
   b.  After the NDIS driver unloads, click OK to continue.
   
   c.  When the test is complete, click OK to exit. PROSet
      reloads the driver.
   
   d.  Restart the computer. You must restart the computer
      before accessing any network drives.


Installing the PROSet adapter diagnostic and configuration
software
------------------------------------------------------------

Intel's PROSet software allows you to test the adapter in
the Windows 95 environment.  It can also resolve some
Windows 95 issues that may result from changing or updating
adapter hardware.

1  From the Explorer, double click on the 3.5 floppy disk
   icon.  The Explore function can be accessed by clicking
   on the Windows 95 Start button with the right mouse
   button.

2  Locate the PROSet icon in the root directory of the
   diskette and click the right mouse button. From the menu
   that appears, click Install.

3  When the PROSet software has been copied to your
   computer, go to the control panel and click on the PROSet
   icon. PROSet examines your computer and displays the
   PROSet Window. This window shows the adapter's I/O
   address, interrupt and Ethernet address.
   
   NOTE: The adapter's interrupt is set by the computer's
   BIOS. If you have to change the interrupt, some computers
   allow you to change this setting, and some don't. Check
   your computer's documentation for details. PROSet will
   inform you of any problems with the current setting.

4  Click Test to begin diagnostics.
