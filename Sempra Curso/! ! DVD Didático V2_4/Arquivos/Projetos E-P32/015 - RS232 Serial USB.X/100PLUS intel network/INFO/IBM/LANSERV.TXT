Adapters:
=========================================================================

Location of files:  \NDIS\E100B.OS2   (OS/2* driver)
                    \NDIS\E100BEO2.NIF
      
                         or
      
                    \NDIS\E100B.DOS   (DOS driver)
                    \NDIS\E100BEDS.NIF (DLR and LSP installation file)

NOTE: LAN Requester needs DOS 3.3 through 5, but if you're using DOS 6.0
      or higher, run SETVER.EXE prior to using the executable files found
      on the DOS LAN Requester disks. See your DOS manual if you need
      help with SETVER.EXE.


Sample configuration file
-------------------------

PROTOCOL.INI (will include):

[E100B_NIF]
   DriverName = E100B$


General installation - LAN Server and OS/2 Requester (4.0 or 3.0)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1  Run the MPTS utility with LAN Server 4.0 or OS/2 Requester 4.0 (Run
   the LAPS utility with LAN Server 3.0 or OS/2 Requester 3.0)

2  Click Install.

3  When prompted, insert the Intel Configuration and Drivers disk in a
   floppy drive, specify A:\NDIS for driver location, and click OK.

4  When Install reads the E100BEO2.NIF, installation is complete. Click
   OK.  The adapter driver has been copied to your system.

5  Click Configure from the MPTS window.

6  At the Configure window, make sure the LAN adapters and protocols
   button is on and click CONFIGURE.

7  At the LAPS Configuration window, select the Intel EtherExpress
   PRO/100+ adapter (OS/2 driver: E100B.OS2) from the Network Adapters
   window.
   
   Click Add in the Network Adapter window to add the PRO/100+ PCI
   adapter to the current configuration.

8  Select your desired Protocol(s) from the Protocol window and click Add
   from this window to add the protocol(s) to the current configuration.

9  Click OK when you're done and follow the prompts to exit MPTS. Your
   CONFIG.SYS is automatically updated.
   
   Shutdown and reset your system so the changes can take effect.


General installation under DOS (DOS LAN Services)
=================================================

NOTE: Due to a problem with the DLS installation utility, you need to
      complete the following steps before executing the installation of
      DLS:
   
      1  On DLS Diskette 1, make a directory off the root called NDIS.
      
      2  Copy the file E100B.DOS (from the \NDIS directory of the Intel
         Configuration and Drivers) into this new directory \NDIS on DLS
         Diskette 1.

1  Run the DOS LAN Services installation program at the DOS workstation.
   Follow the prompts.

2  When presented with an adapter list, select Network card not shown in
   list below.

3  When prompted for the location of the OEMSETUP.INF file, insert the
   Intel Configuration and Drivers disk in your drive and enter A:\NDIS
   as the path.

4  Select the Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ adapter from the list.  Follow
   the prompts.

5  Enter your machine name, username and domain name.

6  Set the options as you need; then highlight "The listed options are
   correct" and press Enter.

7  Accept the defaults on the next screen, highlight "The listed options
   are correct" and press Enter.

8  Set the Speed, Duplex mode, or Slot Device if needed. We recommend
   accepting the defaults. Then highlight "The listed options are
   correct" and press Enter.

9  You may be asked to insert DLS disks. Follow the prompts to complete
   the installation and restart your computer for changes to take effect.


General Installation under DOS: LAN Support Program (LSP)
=========================================================

1  Run DXMAID from the LAN Support Program disk.

2  Follow the prompts and instructions.

3  When prompted, insert the Intel Configuration and Drivers disk and
   enter the pathname A:\NDIS.

4  The default configuration is suitable for most environments.  We
   recommend accepting the defaults.

5  After the installation is complete, restart your computer for the
   changes to take affect.


General Installation under DOS (DOS LAN Requester)
==================================================

1  Run the DOS LAN Requester installation program at the DOS workstation.
   Follow the prompts to configure your DOS LAN Requester as you require.

2  After the installation is complete, restart your computer for the
   changes to take affect.


Advanced settings
=================
   
   SPEED: (optional; parameters are [Auto / 10 / 100]) The parameter
      disables Auto-Speed Detect and causes the adapter to function at
      the speed indicated. If the FORCEDUPLEX parameter is assigned to
      either 1 or 2, the SPEED parameter is required because auto-speed
      sensing is disabled if the duplex mode is forced. Auto-negotiate
      devices cannot detect speed changes in this configuration until the
      driver is reloaded.[Example: SPEED=100]
   
   FORCEDUPLEX: Full duplex and auto-negotiate capabilities vary between
      the PRO/100 TX and the PRO/100 T4 adapters.

         EtherExpress PRO/100+ TX adapter: Supports auto-negotiate, full
         and half duplex at 10 or 100 Mbps.

         EtherExpress PRO/100B T4 adapter: Supports full and half duplex
         at 10 Mbps; supports only half duplex at 100 Mbps.  Auto-
         negotiate is not a valid option at either speed.
   
      This parameter disables Auto-Negotiate capability and forces the
      adapter to operate in Half or Full Duplex mode. The SPEED parameter
      must be specified and must be valid if the default of Auto-
      negotiate is changed. Options for FORCEDUPLEX are Auto (for auto-
      negotiate), 1 (for half), 2 (for full). [Example: FORCEDUPLEX = 2]
   
   SLOT: (required for multiple adapters) This parameter is optional if
      only one adapter is present.  If it is specified but is incorrect,
      a message indicates that the value doesn't match the configuration
      but the driver finds the adapter and loads anyway.
   
      This parameter is required if more than one adapter is present in
      either one bus or multiple PCI buses of a system. The parameter
      tells the driver which adapter it controls. The SLOT number is the
      encoded value of the PCI adapter's device location. To determine
      the slot number, load the driver with only the DRIVERNAME parameter
      specified.  The driver reports all the slots that have PCI
      adapter(s) installed. You can determine which card is in which slot
      by using SETUP.EXE and matching the Ethernet addresses of the
      adapter to the device number specified in View Configuration.
      [Example: SLOT=0x1C]
